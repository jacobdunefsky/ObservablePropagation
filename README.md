# Observable Propagation

This repository contains the code used to carry out the experiments in our paper on observable propagation. Please note that the code is rather messy, spread out across a number of Jupyter notebooks.

The following is a guide to which notebooks contain code for which experiments in the paper:
* `ObsPropCode.ipynb`:
  * Section 4.1: feature vector norms versus path patching scores; cosine similarities and coupling coefficients; code for getting feature scores from the Pile
  * Section 4.2: code for getting `n_bias` and `n_subj` feature scores
  * Appendix E
  * Appendix F
* `BestFitScores.ipynb`:
  * Section 4.1: Code for calculating the best fit slope and r^2 for feature vector scores
  * Section 4.2, Appendix I: Maximum activating examples
* `OtherObservables.ipynb`:
  * Section 4.3
